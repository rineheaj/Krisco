# Krisco 🐾

A small web app created in memory of my beloved dog, Krisco.

## About
Krisco was more than a pet — he was family. This app is a tribute to his life, his joy, and the unconditional love he gave.  
It’s meant to be a place to share memories, photos, and stories, and to keep his spirit alive in a digital space.

## Features
- **Guestbook**: Visitors can leave messages, memories, or kind words.
- **Photo Gallery**: A collection of Krisco’s happiest moments.
- **Timeline**: Key milestones and cherished events from his life.

## Purpose
This project is both personal and therapeutic, a way to honor Krisco and to connect with others who understand the bond between humans and their dogs.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Storage**: Local file storage for entries and images

## How to Run Locally
